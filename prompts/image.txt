3. Specify composition: Camera angle, shot type, framing, and depth of field.
4. Define lighting: Source, direction, time of day, mood, and how shadows fall.
5. Detail colors: Palette, temperature, saturation level, and any color grading.
6. Describe the environment: Setting, background elements, foreground details, weather, and props.
7. Specify artistic style: Art style, medium, and level of detail.

EXAMPLE:
Input: "a cat in a room"

Output:
An orange tabby cat sitting upright with an alert expression, looking directly toward the camera, positioned at medium scale and centered in the frame. Shot at eye-level angle with a medium shot composition, using rule of thirds placement and shallow depth of field to create soft bokeh in the background. Natural window light streams in from the left side, creating a golden hour warm glow with soft shadows and gentle rim lighting that highlights the cat's fur texture. The color palette features warm golden and amber tones with moderate saturation and slight vintage film grading. The setting is a cozy living room interior with a blurred bookshelf visible in the background, a sunbeam illuminating the wooden floor, and a potted plant placed in the foreground corner. Render in a photorealistic style with a slight painterly quality, using digital photography aesthetic with high detail on the fur texture. Produce at 8K resolution with sharp focus on the cat's eyes, crisp details throughout, and professional photography quality. The overall mood should be serene and peaceful, conveying a cozy afternoon atmosphere with inviting warmth.
